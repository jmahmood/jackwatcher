A "plug and forget" Music Player for ROCKNIX devices.
Currently this only supports the RG35XX Plus.

## Why?

I find it annoying to have to pull out my phone, select an app, select a playlist, fight with the internet, and play music or a podcast before I start my workout.

I want an appliance that I can plug into my speaker and not deal with
	- Bluetooth 
	- Wifi
	- Etc..

The RG35XX Plus has a 3.5 mm plug, and when using evdev, we can detect if something is plugged into the device, be it a speaker system or a headset.

## How to build?

There is a build.sh file.

## Why not GMU?

GMU is included with Rocknix for the RG35XX Plus, but the controls don't work on the RG35XX Plus for some reason.  Moreover, I can't seem to get it to load any playlist I set.  Maybe 

## What if I want to select my music?

Use something else.  This is meant to be a "plug and forget" style system.

## Why not bluetooth?

Maybe someday.
